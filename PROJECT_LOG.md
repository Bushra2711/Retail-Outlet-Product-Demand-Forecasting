# Retail Product Demand Forecasting System

## Project Objective and Brief

The primary objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive forecasting system that predicts product demand across retail outlets using historical sales data. The system employs advanced time series analysis techniques, specifically ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and Prophet models, to generate accurate demand forecasts.

### Core Objectives:
1. **Demand Prediction**: Build a reliable system to forecast product demand at retail outlets
2. **Multi-Model Approach**: Implement and compare both ARIMA and Prophet forecasting methods
3. **Visualization**: Create clear visual representations of forecasts for decision-making
4. **Scalable Solution**: Design a system that can handle multiple product-outlet combinations

### Project Components:

1. **Data Processing**
   - Clean and preprocess historical sales data
   - Handle missing values and outliers
   - Structure data for time series analysis

2. **Model Implementation**
   - ARIMA Model
     - Time series frequency handling
     - Parameter optimization
     - Forecast generation
   
   - Prophet Model
     - Trend and seasonality decomposition
     - Forecast generation with confidence intervals
     - Future date predictions

3. **Visualization System**
   - Individual ARIMA forecast plots
   - Individual Prophet forecast plots
   - Combined comparison plots
   - Clear representation of predictions with confidence intervals

4. **Output Generation**
   - CSV files containing forecasts
   - Visual plots for each product-outlet combination
   - Comparative analysis capabilities

### Current Implementation:

The system successfully:
- Processes retail sales data from multiple outlets
- Generates forecasts using both ARIMA and Prophet models
- Creates two types of visualization:
  - ARIMA-specific forecasts (in `arima_plots/`)
  - Prophet-specific forecasts (in `prophet_plots/`)
- Evaluates model performance and combines forecasts into final predictions

### Technical Details:

1. **Data Structure**
   - Input: Historical sales data with product, outlet, and time information
   - Output: Forecast CSVs and visualization plots

2. **Models Used**
   - ARIMA: For traditional time series forecasting
   - Prophet: For robust forecasting with built-in seasonality handling

3. **Visualization Components**
   - Time series plots
   - Prediction intervals
   - Trend analysis
   - Model comparison charts

### Benefits:
1. Better inventory management
2. Reduced stockouts and overstocking
3. Data-driven decision making
4. Comparative analysis of different forecasting methods

### Future Scope:
1. Integration of external factors (holidays, promotions, etc.)
2. Real-time forecast updates
3. Enhanced visualization dashboard
4. Automated model selection based on performance metrics

This system provides a robust foundation for retail demand forecasting, enabling better inventory management and business planning through data-driven predictions.
